Given some points and an origin point in two-dimensional space, find k points which are nearest to the origin.
Return these points sorted by distance, if they are same in distance, sorted by the x-axis, and if they are same in the x-axis, sorted by y-axis.

Example

Example 1:

Input: points = [[4,6],[4,7],[4,4],[2,5],[1,1]], origin = [0, 0], k = 3 
Output: [[1,1],[2,5],[4,4]]
Example 2:

Input: points = [[0,0],[0,9]], origin = [3, 1], k = 1
Output: [[0,0]]
