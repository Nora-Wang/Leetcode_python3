There is a row of n houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with the color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

 

Example 1:

Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
Example 2:

Input: costs = []
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

costs.length == n
costs[i].length == 3
0 <= n <= 100
1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20


'''
dp[i][j]: min cost for position (i,j)
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1]中的另外两列的数据) + costs[i][j]

            costs[i][1] += min(costs[i - 1][0], costs[i - 1][2])
            costs[i][2] += min(costs[i - 1][0], costs[i - 1][1])
                
        return min(costs[-1])
